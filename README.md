<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The first step to writing a good proposal is to carry out an in-depth research about your topic. Use the discipline word during this section to describe your topic and give background.

<h3> Literature Review</h3>
<p>A good literature review involves carrying out in-depth research on every relevant material on the thesis topic. This can be from books, journals, articles, government publications, and e-books. The literature review section should show how the gaps in knowledge are filling up, the impact the research will have, and why you should embark on the research. </p>
<h3> Methodology</h3>
<p>Methodology is the second step to writing a good proposal. Here, it is essential to indicate the kind of data collection and analysis methods you will use. Explain the data collection process to be sure that you have enough scholarly material to fill the gap. Methodology comes from anthropology, biology, and medical science.</p>
